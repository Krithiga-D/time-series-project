# Advanced Time Series Forecasting with LSTM & Transformer

This project demonstrates advanced multivariate time series forecasting using:

- LSTM Neural Network  
- Transformer Encoder Model  
- Explainability using SHAP  

## Project Files

- data.csv → sample dataset  
- lstm_model.py → LSTM architecture  
- transformer_model.py → Transformer architecture  
- train.py → Training + evaluation + explainability  
- requirements.txt → Required Python libraries  

## How to Run the Project

Install required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt
python train.py
